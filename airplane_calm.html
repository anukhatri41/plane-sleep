            Bring Distractions
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is easier to avoid the stress of flying if you bring some distractions. Downloaded TV shows or movies on a device, books, or games are great ways to keep you mind on something else. Bring enough so that you are entertained the duration of the flight. Often times, airlines have TVs on the flight with movies playing, and recently, some have a service where you can access their content through your own device. Each airline differs, so be sure to check before deciding what to bring.
