            Preparing for Your Flight
        </h2>
        <p>
            To make your flight experience as calm as possible, it is important to prepare before your flight. Below is a list of things you can do to make your experience better and calm your nerves.

        <h3>
            Breathing Exercises
        </h3>
        <p>
            Slow, deep breathing helps you disengage from your surroundings and unsettling thoughts. Studies have shown that having long exhales relaxes the nervous system, which is responsible for short breaths when panicking.

        <h3>
            Arrive Early to the Airport
        
        </h3>
        <p>
            By arriving early to the airport, you add less stress to the whole experience, and you also have more time to get relaxed and calm about the flight.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Bring Distractions
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is easier to avoid the stress of flying if you bring some distractions. Downloaded TV shows or movies on a device, books, or games are great ways to keep you mind on something else. Bring enough so that you are entertained the duration of the flight. Often times, airlines have TVs on the flight with movies playing, and recently, some have a service where you can access their content through your own device. Each airline differs, so be sure to check before deciding what to bring.

            Avoid Caffeine
        </h3>
        <p>
            Caffeine increases anxiety and adds nervousness. By avoiding caffeine, you will prevent adding even more anxiety
        </p>
        <h3>
            Bring Headphones
        </h3>
        <p>
            Headphones can help drown out the noise of being on an airplane. Noise-cancelling headphones are even more helpful because they block out much of the whtie noise, which is sometimes what makes people anxious while on a plan.
