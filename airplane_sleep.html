            Be Careful of What You Eat and Drink
        </h3>
        <p>
            Due to altitude changes and sitting for prolonged periods, flights can cause flatulence in the body. Some foods to avoid that commonly create gas would be legumes and broccoli. Soft drinks should also be avoided because of the carbonation contributing to the build up of gas.
            Often times, airports have many restaurants with carb-loaded and fatty foods; those should also be avoided because they can cause indigestion and heartburn.
            Lastly, it is important to stay hydrated by drinking water. Being in a plane at such high altitudes will make you dehydrated should you not stay properly hydrated.
