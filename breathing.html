            Breathing Exercises to Help You Calm Down
        </h1>
        <p>
            Deep breathing aids in reducing stress due to it sending a message to your brain to relax, which tells your body to also relax. Your heart rate decreases, blood pressure decreases, and your breathing slows down.

        <h3>
            Lengthen Your Exhale
        </h3>
        <p>
            The act of exhaling is actually what calms you down. Inhaling many times quickly is actually what leads to hyperventilating, the opposite of being calm. Try exhaling longer than inhaling to relax even more.
